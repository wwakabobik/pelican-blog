1. Alone in the Dark (1992)
---------------------------

Autumn 1994. I walk into my father's room and sit down at the computer, turning on the large button on the monitor, then on the system unit, waiting for the number 40 to appear, and pressing TURBO. Finally, I turn on the "monitor ears" - Genius speakers attached to the monitor with a silver mouse. The red light comes on and a barely audible warm rustle breaks out. On the table is a plastic box containing five 5.25" floppy disks with this... creepy game... well, and a couple of other disks from my father. But you don't need to copy anything anymore - the game is already on the computer. Just go to NC and press enter on ALONE.EXE.

**Hello, Commander Norton!

I knew it would be scary, but I didn't know how much. Although I had already launched the game several times, I... found myself in an abandoned mansion. I was in a completely unfamiliar world, and I didn't know what to expect. The mansion was dark and gloomy. I could hear strange noises, and it seemed to me that someone was following me. The warm crackling of the speakers was filled with more and more terrifying sounds of an invisible presence. And when I started exploring the mansion, barely managing to get out of the first room, I discovered that it was full of ghosts and monsters. I was scared to death, but I was determined to unravel the mystery of the mansion.

**Monsters are tough, and the weapon is of course

The game was very atmospheric. The gloomy graphics and terrifying sounds created a sense of real horror. After the dynamic arcades, this game was sluggish and sticky, my 386, it seems, the game was a little harder, which also added to the fear. But the most important thing is this striking difference from all other games - it seemed to come out of virtual reality. Here everything was voluminous, real 3D graphics, like in "Lawnmower Man", and the same insane atmosphere. What to do? How? Fight, come on, be quicker!

The gameplay was pretty simple. I could explore the mansion, solve puzzles, and fight monsters. Very slowly, inefficiently. The game was not easy. I often died from monsters or traps. But I didn't give up. I was determined to unravel the mystery of the mansion. I couldn't get far in the game, but I read the walkthrough in the "Encyclopedia of IBM PC Computer Games", read it and imagined what else was creepy going on there, worms? What? And what does it look like, I tried, I tried to pass and could not.

**These worms became a symbol of a dead end

The game features many monsters (most of which I didn't see in my childhood (maybe fortunately)), inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. For example, in the basement of the mansion there are monsters that look like fishmen, and in the library you can meet a monster with huge claws. Alone in the Dark was the first game in the survival horror genre, and it had a major impact on the development of this genre. In Resident Evil or Silent Hill, released much later, it is easy to recognize these very strange camera angles, a certain clumsiness and vulnerability of the characters, which became the basis of the genre. However, if Alone in The Dark is one of the first attempts to create a polished three-dimensional horror world, albeit with pre-rendered locations, but not the only one that formed the basis of future famous horror games.

For me, Alone in the Dark was the first computer horror game, but chronologically, of course, it is not the first graphical, let alone the first text horror story on PC.

2. Maniac Mansion (1987)
------------------------

**I sit on the unfolded sofa and play with plastic animals, giving them orders to ride on this strange iron machine. I sit behind my father, who is playing something. Being the ruler of animals is of course interesting, but it is much more interesting to look over my father's shoulder. On the computer screen was an abandoned mansion. I watched my father control a character wandering around the house. The mansion was dark and gloomy. Strange creatures inhabited it, making terrifying sounds. My father often died, and I saw him die at the hands of monsters or traps.

**Death and fun

I didn't play Maniac Mansion myself, but even watching the game was a bit creepy. Maybe I didn't play it back then because I didn't have a walkthrough and I didn't understand the English text. Maniac Mansion is a visual adventure game in which the player must select word commands to control the character. The game is divided into several rooms, each with various items and characters. The player must use items and interact with characters to progress through the story.

The game was quite difficult for its time. Players had to be very careful not to die at the hands of monsters or traps. This is quite unusual for the genre. If Sierra games have the ability to die, then in Maniac Mansion from Lucas Art, in whose games everything is quite safe, the first game is the height of bloodthirstiness and a test of ingenuity and reaction.

** Maniac Mansion is a record holder for references to it in other quests in new games such as Thimbleweed Park or Unusual Findings

The game's plot takes place in the abandoned mansion of Professor Flint, who kidnapped a girl named Daisy. Five friends, David, Sue, Eddy, Jackie, and Roy, team up to save her.

The player must explore the mansion to find Daisy and defeat Professor Flint and prevent the world from being taken over by an evil genius. Along the way, the player will face many dangers, including monsters, traps, and puzzles. The player must choose one of five characters to complete the game. Each character has their own unique abilities that can help in completing the game.

**I don't know where the lab is

One of the most iconic features of the game is its humor. The game is full of black humor and parodies of popular films and works of literature. In fact, this character will be transferred to all subsequent Lucas Arts games.

Another iconic feature of the game is its atmosphere. The game is very atmospheric and scary, especially for its time. It is inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe.

In 1993, a sequel to the game was released called Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle. In this game, players control three characters who must prevent the spread of green slime that turns people into mutants. The game was also very atmospheric and scary, and it was well-received by critics.

**Technology has moved on

In 2017, a remake of the game was released called Maniac Mansion: The Mansion of Madness. This remake updated the graphics and sound, and also added new elements, such as new puzzles and secrets. The remake was also well-received by critics.

Despite the cult status of Maniac Mansion and the maximum brutality and cruelty of the gameplay (oh yes, games of the 90s were brutal and cruel - and rivers of blood in Mortal Kombat, and dismemberment in Prince of Persia), nevertheless, as my father abandoned the game, not having completed it to the end, so my imagination was captured not by it, but by another series in which my father played, namelyâ€¦


3. Laura Bow (1989)
-------------------

The Laura Bow series of classic adventure games began in 1989 with the release of the game "The Colonel's Bequest". It was one of the first games in the genre of detective adventure with elements of mystery and horror. The action takes place in the 1920s in an old mansion of Colonel Dijon. The player must investigate a series of mysterious murders of guests of the mansion. The atmosphere of the game perfectly conveys the gloomy spirit of an old mansion with ghosts and secrets.

The second game in the series, "The Dagger of Amon Ra", was released in 1992. Laura Bow is now in the role of a young museum employee in New York in the 1920s. She must unravel the theft of a valuable artifact from the museum's collection. The gameplay has become more diverse, with more characters to interact with. However, the dark atmosphere of a detective with elements of mystery is fully preserved.

Laura Bow is still not a horror game, but the mysterious atmosphere, the anxiety of touching some ancient secret, was quite winning for me over the atmosphere of a rather absurd B-movie style, in the same Maniac Mansion. The game was more serious, and therefore I believed in what was happening much more. It is difficult to say what my father's opinion was, but perhaps, after Police Quests, it was one of those rare games that he thoughtfully and for a long time sat until the victorious end. I can't say where he got the guide (I don't remember that I met it anywhere in the books later), I don't remember how the plot looked to me then, because everything was in English, but my father, seeing my interest, explained something along the way - very fragmentary; and turning off the computer, he always summarized the events, what conclusions he made and where he was going to go. And it was all the more offensive to me that I missed the ending of the story, and asked my father to replay, but the story was over...

The strong point of the game is the atmosphere of the era

Both games are remembered to me by interesting characters, an exciting plot with unexpected twists, and challenging puzzles. The investigation has reached a dead end? You'll have to search all the locations again for clues! It's really exciting and doesn't let go of the screen until the very denouement. The atmosphere of old mansions and museums is conveyed very authentically.

Of course, Laura Bow is more mystery, quest, rather than a full-fledged horror, but unlike Maniac Mansion, it still radiates an alarming atmosphere and plays nicely without the need to launch a remake. Laura Bow is a true classic of the adventure genre, and it stands apart from the style inherent in Sierra quests, everything, to my taste, is more logical and fits into the detective plot. Anyone who loves dark detective stories with ghosts will appreciate these games!


4. Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1990)
--------------------------------------

Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is a 1991 graphic adventure game with elements of horror and mystery. The main character, Elvira, arrives at her old castle, and then creepy things start to happen.

The game itself

This game belongs to the category of those that my father played, but they were unplayable. On the one hand, thanks to pirates, and on the other hand, because of pirates. The game versions were mercilessly cut, and made the game unplayable. Since it was the early nineties, games were copied from floppy disk to floppy disk, packed with arj and cut with long. I can't say that the game is very big - the full version is only 2.6 megabytes, but firstly, 3.5" floppy disks were just starting to appear, and on 5.25" floppy disks the game took up as many as 8 disks! Later, there will be one more version on two 3.5" disks (1.9MB), and it will also be recorded on Crazy Collection. Why? Because in addition to broken disks, in order to somehow adequately fit the game on a floppy disk, pirates cut out heavy content from the game, namely videos... oh, videos in 1990!

The game's strengths and weaknesses

The game uses cutscenes and heavily compressed FMV (full-motion video) in key moments, which gives it a cinematic feel. In addition to exploring the castle and solving logical puzzles, there are arcade elements. You need to show reaction - dodge dangers, fight monsters. There is a health bar - if Elvira takes too much damage, she will die. And these deaths are not from dead ends and traps of Sierra quests, but a real role-playing game, with combat, burdened with resurrecting monsters. Starting with this game, very strange and contradictory hybrids of genres begin. Perhaps, Elvira, or rather two games in the series - Elvira: Mistress of the Dark and Elvira 2: The Jaws of Cerberus are pioneers in this genre. First-person view? Arrows, like in a dungeon crawler? And words-actions? Everything is in place!

Graphics and atmosphere

The graphics and character animation are well-done. The music and sounds enhance the dark atmosphere. Elvira's humor defuses the situation. The game is atmospheric, with a nonlinear plot and multiple endings. During my attempts to complete the game, I was particularly impressed by the trashy but scary moments, such as the cook with a bloody cleaver looming over the player, melting faces, and a creepy human stew.

Conclusion

The game's strengths include a well-developed world, interesting characters, and a memorable atmosphere. The weaknesses include sometimes too arcade gameplay, and sometimes illogical puzzles. It should be noted that in the early 90s, the personality of Elvira was certainly impressive - quite a colorful, powerful witch, but she was completely unfamiliar to the layman. And what a surprise it was to learn about Elvira in a TV series only in the early 2000s!

Overall, this is an excellent representative of classic adventure games with elements of horror and black humor. Fans of horror and irony, Elvira and the Addams Family will appreciate the unique atmosphere of Elvira!

5. Dangerous Dave: Haunted Mansion (1991)
-----------------------------------------

Dangerous Dave in Haunted Mansion is a 1991 action-platform game that was a hit among school children in the 1990s and early 2000s. By the end of the 1990s, my friends and I would play it after school, competing for time and points, trying to complete levels with one bullet, two bullets, like a double-barreled shotgun - without reloading the entire magazine, to kill certain enemies, or not kill them, or not jump, and so on. In general, the ultimate challenge constructor, what and how you can do.

The first part was still a familiar arcade...

For me, the series began in the mid-1990s with the first part of Dangerous Dave (1990), which fit on one 3.5-inch floppy disk (and was drawn with a felt-tip pen DDAVE). In total, no less than disgusting and creepy Dangerous Daves were released four parts for DOS. I can't say that I played the first part much, partly because of its difficulty (ah, and Commander Keen there too), partly because of the disgusting feeling of my own mortality and the disgustingness of this mortality. I am not afraid of spiders in life, but spiders in Dave are simply the standard of disgusting creatures and close-knit constricting horror for me. A completely different matter was the fourth part, because it is more fun with friends, and calmer, and yes and ... and what? The game was even more packed with monsters and cutscenes!

A spider sat on his neck

In the game, you had to explore an abandoned mansion full of zombie monsters, bats, and ghosts. The main character Dave is armed with only a pump-action shotgun, but that didn't stop us from feeling like real badass heroes from 1980s horror movies. Red baseball cap on his head, and off he goes over the fence. Dave is almost like us when we climbed onto construction sites and into boarded-up buildings of an old kindergarten.

In addition to shooting, the game featured jumping across chasms, collecting bonuses, and finding keys to open doors. At the same time, the atmosphere of an old castle with flickering torches on the walls sometimes made goosebumps run down your spine. Nervous startle and hold back the lump rising in your throat. Especially memorable were the creepy Dave death animations from zombie bites or falling into a chasm, no matter how many times you lost before!

Black humor and Romero are inseparable

The graphics looked great for those years, the gameplay was engaging with its simplicity and dynamism. It was a great game for competitions and spending time with friends. And now sometimes I want to go back to that carefree school time and go through this pixel mansion with Dave again.

6. Waxworks (1992)
------------------

Waxworks is an adventure quest with horror elements released in 1992. Although I had seen this game in old publications of the 1990s, I personally did not play it at the time. But recently I finally got to know Waxworks from a clean slate. And, in general, it turned out to be curious.

Before us... dungeon crawler?
In the game, we find ourselves in a wax figure museum, where we need to go through 4 portals to different dark worlds. These can be a dark forest with witches, a castle with Dracula, a pyramid of a pharaoh, or Victor Frankenstein's laboratory.
The gameplay of the game is primarily about the quest, puzzles, and atmosphere. You need to explore locations, collect and use items, and interact with characters. Along the way, there are logical puzzles and arcade elements such as battles or escaping from enemies. It's funny that in my previous review of dungeon crawler games, I could have mentioned Waxworks as well. After all, it's not just a quest, action, arcade, or even a crawler - with turn-based battles, no matter how strange it may sound. In this game, we will not only have to solve puzzles, but also fight various monsters - zombies, vampires, Frankenstein's monsters. Battles take place in turn-based mode using various weapons and spells. This gives the game the atmosphere of dungeons in the spirit of classic RPGs. To be honest, I don't remember anywhere else I've seen such a pronounced mix of genres. Probably, it's still more of a crawler, but one that was made by quest developers. Which is not surprising, because this is Adventure Soft, the authors of Simon the Sorcerer and Elvira, and, in fact, is the spiritual successor of the series - they have a lot in common, and even more from the crawler.
I'm confused
The graphics for the 90s look very detailed and stylish. Locations in dark forests or castles convey the atmosphere of true horror. Music only enhances the effect of being in the world of horror.
Waxworks is an excellent representative of the genre of adventure RPGs (or point-and-click quests?) with horror elements. In my opinion, the playability of Waxworks is higher in modern times than that of Elvira, although there is noticeably less humor. Quests, battles with monsters, dark atmosphere - I recommend it to all fans of classic 16-bit games!

7. Last Half of Darkness (1992)
-------------------------------

Last Half of Darkness: Shadows of the Night is a little-known but quality representative of horror point-and-click adventure games from the early 1990s. Forgive me, but for some reason the visual style strongly reminds me of the first parts of King's Quest, if all the light tones were removed and all shades of blue and black were left. In general, this is one of the darkest games of the early nineties, with a completely horror-themed plot and detailed elaboration.

The game is like a transitional stage between text horrors and graphic ones
Actually, Last Half of Darkness is three full-fledged games released in 1989, 1992, and 1993. But I would say that each of them is very, very short, so they are more of a single whole, as I see it. My narrative interval does not include sequels, but I should also mention them, namely Last Half of Darkness (2000), Last Half of Darkness: Shadows of the Servants (2005), Last Half of Darkness: Beyond the Spirit's Eye (2007), Tomb of Zojir: Last Half of Darkness (2009), and Last Half of Darkness: Society of the Serpent Moon (2011), which are, in fact, remakes and sequels to the first three classic games.

Tomb of Zojir is just as dark as the first games
So, the action takes place in an old mansion, where the main character comes to visit a friend. However, in the house, he is in for some creepy surprises. From the very beginning, the game creates a dark atmosphere - candles are flickering everywhere, the floorboards are creaking, and the wind is whistling outside the window. As the game progresses, it becomes clear that the house is inhabited by supernatural forces, and the protagonist will have to use his wits to get out of there alive.

The particularly memorable scenes of the protagonist's death at the hands of ghosts or vampires, if you make a mistake, are set to the sound of a funeral march. The graphics and sound are at a high level for their time, completely immersing you in the dark atmosphere of horror.

Unfortunately, the graphics already looked outdated compared to other games at the time. And some puzzles can only be solved by trial and error. This is probably why the game did not gain wide popularity, despite its interesting plot and atmosphere.

However, fans of retro horrors should pay attention to this little-known quest. A creepy mansion with ghosts, breathtaking escapes from monsters - Last Half of Darkness will definitely give you the feel of a classic horror!

Playability? Overall yes, although with the existence of wonderful remakes, I would be more inclined towards them.

8. The Legacy: Realm of Terror (1992)
-------------------------------------

The Legacy: Realm of Terror is another unique genre hybrid, combining a quest and a dungeon crawler with a first-person view. Another unconventional look at adventure games of that time!

In the beginning, we choose from 4 characters with different characteristics (yes, in a quest - the characters have different characteristics!). At the beginning, the player finds himself in front of the gates of a mysterious mansion, with no memories of himself. Along the way, you will explore an extensive area - the rooms of the castle, catacombs, cemetery, garden, and other dark locations - like in a classic dungeon crawler.

The map is drawn automatically - isn't that beautiful!

At the same time, there are elements of a quest - finding and combining objects, solving puzzles, interacting with characters. I especially remember the episode with the room where you have to dash past swinging daggers - you need to accurately calculate the trajectory - adrenaline is off the charts! In addition, the disturbing atmosphere is created by the musical accompaniment and sound effects - creaky floorboards, creaky ambient sounds...

A separate mention deserves the plot - many twists and turns, the mysterious past of the protagonist, which must be revealed. The game keeps you on edge until the very end.

You'll have to find the keys, as in any other point-and-click quest

Despite being released in 1993, the graphics look very high-quality and detailed, creating a unique dark atmosphere. The Legacy: Realm of Terror is a masterpiece that combines the best of what was in RPGs and quests of that time. A must-see for fans of retro games!

In general, this is the very moment to pay attention to. In the 90s, developers were not afraid to experiment and mix the unmixable, often failing and disappearing into oblivion. But at the same time, the horror genre looks a little isolated, it is very noticeable how the developers are trying to break their backs to convey the atmosphere, using tricks - pre-rendered backgrounds (the game looks richer than many crawlers of those years), the game has an explorable map, which is drawn in the visited corridors (no need to fill in a notebook in a cell anymore), and even about the constant attempts to make realistic cutscenes, you are amazed at how it all fit and was distributed on floppy disks...

9. Dark Seed (1992)
-------------------

Dark Seed is a cult psychological horror game released in 1992 that was ahead of its time in its use of live-action cutscenes.

The mansion looks like it's not from this reality

The gameplay is classic point-and-click. We explore the house and its surroundings, solve puzzles, and find items. The story follows Mike, an ordinary guy who starts having terrifying visions. His nightmares bleed into reality, and Mike must unravel their mystery to save the world from an invasion of dark forces.

The gameplay consists of exploring locations, searching for clues, talking to characters, and solving puzzles. The surreal visions of Mike create a special atmosphere. It's hard to believe that everything that's happening isn't just a crazy dream. The atmosphere balances on the edge of reality, conveying the disintegration of consciousness.

Reality and psychedelia blend

In 1995, the second part was released, which plays and looks like a real movie. The graphics use pre-rendered backgrounds and live-action cutscenes with actors. The game was one of the first to experiment with cutscenes. The highlight of the show was the story cutscenes with real actors - at the time, this was an unprecedented innovation. The transition from rendered locations to FMV is so smooth that it sometimes seems like the game is entirely made up of video. The sense of presence is incredibly strong by the standards of the 1990s.

I have too many thoughts

Dark Seed was created by a team led by H.R. Giger, the artist of the film "Alien". The atmosphere of the game conveys madness and the feeling of a waking dream. A memorable representative of psychological horror in games.

Visual effects, music, and voice acting are all top-notch. It's no wonder that the game was made by a team led by Giger. Dark Seed is still impressive and scary today, ahead of its time. A masterpiece of psychological horror in games!

The line between characters shot on a green screen and pre-rendered backgrounds is sometimes very difficult to see, as if it were a whole film shot

I didn't get my hands on the game in the 90s, and that's probably even a plus. I only saw a clipping with a screenshot from the game, and I don't know why that particular screenshot was chosen, because it didn't make me want to play. But today, browsing retro libraries, I got stuck for several hours before I could tear myself away and return to the review. I think that at least if you occasionally dabble in indie horror games in the classic point-and-click setting (for example, this spring I really enjoyed Loretta), then you should not miss Dark Seed. And in general, the psychology of what is happening and the artistic work are impressive at the level of a work of art. Definitely re-play!

10. Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers (1993)
----------------------------------------------

To be honest, I didn't really want to go into detail about this game at first. It's a cult classic that doesn't need any introduction. But I understand that it may not be familiar to everyone, at least due to its age.

This bookstore is like a home away from home

This point-and-click adventure game was released in 1993 and became a true classic of the genre. Players take on the role of Gabriel Knight, a supernatural investigator who is investigating a series of mysterious murders in New Orleans.

A unique story inspired by New Orleans folklore and voodoo

The dark atmosphere, well-developed characters, and numerous plot twists keep players on the edge of their seats until the very end. The dusty atmosphere of searching for the supernatural, offices, typewriters, and the juicy 80s are a visual, sonic, and scripting feast.

Each location has its own atmosphere

The locations are rendered as real photographs of New Orleans, which enhances the sense of immersion. Movement between scenes is smooth, and the gameplay is intuitive.

The voice acting deserves special mention - there are many dialogues, professional actors. This gave the game an unprecedented level of cinematic quality.

Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a benchmark for the genre, to which people still refer today. Atmospheric story, innovative gameplay, and high-quality execution - there are many epithets for this masterpiece!

The game is distinguished from many in its genre by its cinematic staging of scenes

Almost everyone in my circle who had a computer played the Gabriel Knight series. Of course, my father (for me it was a sequel to Laura Bow, although he tried it and gave up soon), my friends, who did not like quests, but were imbued with the liveliness of what was happening. If not the first part, with magnificent pixel art, then the second, with FMV, crookedly translated by pirates. Surprisingly, the second part (which I didn't have) was brought by my older sister's ex-boyfriend, and we finished it together, sharing tips if someone got stuck.

The remake is a good choice if you want to experience the game in a modern way

Last year, I decided to replay the classic (and still pass it, yes, to close the gestalt), and I came across the remake. In general, the remake is beautiful, yes, without the charm of pixel art, but making the game more acceptable for modern players. But the most wild thing turned out to be that the very essence of the game, the atmosphere, the dialogues on the edge, were mercilessly cut out by SJW. You can't make sexist jokes about women, and even more so about voodoo witches (and we know what they are like at least from Monkey Island). And in the end, the plot seems insipid and unnatural. So if you're going to play, keep that in mind.

11. 7th Guest (1993)
--------------------

The second game on the list, besides Alone in The Dark, that I played myself as a child, and not just played, it was my favorite multimedia game (yes, because it was on CD) after Cyberia. In general, this is one of the first CDs that appeared in our house. The first was the virtual shooting gallery Mad Dog McCree (oh, despite all the negative reviews, I love both of its parts dearly). And the second is the "Seventh Guest". And this is just the case when games on CD, as in advertising, turned a computer into a machine of ultimate virtual multimedia reality of the new generation.

The haunted house is now yours. With ghosts
The 7th Guest is a point-and-click adventure game released in 1993 by Trilobyte. The game was one of the first to be released on CD-ROM and used cutting-edge technologies of the time to create a dark and atmospheric atmosphere.
The 7th Guest uses a combination of technologies to create its 3D world. Most of the rooms in the game are pre-rendered, but they were created with such mastery that they look very realistic. Some rooms, such as the library and the ballroom, are even interactive and can be explored by the player.
Cook me, mother-in-law, cabbage soup!
In addition to the pre-rendered rooms, The 7th Guest also uses FMV videos to tell the story. These videos are interviews with characters who were killed in the mansion. They help the player understand what happened in the house and unravel the mystery of the 7th guest.
The 7th Guest is a horror game, and it does its job perfectly. The atmosphere of the game is dark and sinister. The mansion where the action takes place is filled with ghosts and strange noises. The player constantly feels in danger, and even the most ordinary actions can lead to an unexpected frightening event. My first encounter with ghosts on the stairs made me drop all the puzzles and just not turn on the game for another week.
The player in the role of an unnamed guest arrives at the mansion to attend a party. However, when he arrives, the mansion is empty, and the player is trapped. The player must explore the mansion and unravel its secrets to find a way out.
Clowns always stay
As the player explores the mansion, he learns about what happened in the house. Seven guests were killed in the mansion, and the player must find out who the killer was.
The 7th Guest is a puzzle game, and it has many challenging puzzles to solve. The puzzles are varied and require the player to use logic, ingenuity, and observation.
Some puzzles are quite simple, but others can be very difficult. Some puzzles require the player to use objects he finds in the mansion, while others require the player to solve complex logical problems. I will never forget the wild puzzle with the creepy cake. Oh, and the musical puzzle with the piano? Pain and death for a person without musical hearing...
If the guests ate pies, they washed them down with blood
The 7th Guest is a classic game that still scares and engages players. The game uses cutting-edge technologies of its time to create a dark and atmospheric atmosphere. The game also has a complex plot and many challenging puzzles.
The 7th Guest is a must-play for all fans of horror and puzzles. I first played The 7th Guest in 1995, and it made a big impression on me. The game was incredibly atmospheric, and I was constantly on my guard. The puzzles were challenging, but they were also very interesting. Today, the game still looks pretty good, although, of course, on large monitors, I would carefully upscale the image, perhaps with filters. On the other hand, the game was remade for VR, and it sounds very cool.

12. Doom (1993)
---------------

Doom has been talked about millions of times. Comics have been written about Doom, movies have been made about Doom, books have been written about Doom by foreign and Russian authors. The word itself has become a household name. Monsters have become timeless Easter eggs in games, and a plush cacodemon should be sitting on your couch, and at night you should fall asleep to the reversed howl of Romero's impaled head.

Dudu-du-ru-ru-ru! Dudu-du-ru-ru-ruuuu!

But I'm not talking about that. Doom was originally positioned by Romero and Carmack as a horror game, yes, an action game, but it's a dark horror, dark corridors with flickering lights, claustrophobia, and loneliness. And the atmosphere of horror depended on your perception, to the extent that you immerse yourself in the role of a brutal soldier. Doom, in my opinion, is not scary because of something supernatural. Even if you fall into a dark room with invisible pinkies, you still have your pistol/rifle and your legs. Doom scares you with something else - that you won't cope, that you'll run out of ammo, that there's no help to be found, and it's useless to wait in the hope that your health will regenerate, like in modern shooters. It scares you with its loneliness, and with the increasing immersion in something you'll never get out of. And you know what? We didn't get out. We fell into Doom, and it stayed with us.

Too bad for the guy...

That's why I simply couldn't not mention it in this list. I will also deliberately omit those FPS games that could be included for reasons of "horror" of origin, such as Heretic and Hexen, especially since they are primarily inspired by the immortal Doom, both in terms of engine and approach.

13. Noctropolis (1994)
----------------------

In 1994, Trilobyte released the game Noctropolis. You may not have even heard of it, as I didn't in the 90s. The game is set in a dark and atmospheric noir style and tells the story of a group of people who are drawn into strange events in a mysterious city.

Pre-rendered, FMV, green screen...

Noctropolis is a horror game, and it does a great job. The game's atmosphere is dark and foreboding. The city where the action takes place is filled with gothic architecture, dark alleyways, and shadowy corners. The player constantly feels in danger, and even the most ordinary actions can lead to an unexpected frightening event.

I like red more!

The game's story tells the tale of a group of people who are drawn into strange events in a mysterious city. The protagonist, Jonathan, comes to town for his father's funeral, but soon discovers that the city is not what it seems. He finds an abandoned house inhabited by nightmarish creatures. The player must explore the house and solve puzzles to find a way to leave the city, with his friends who also found themselves trapped inside, and together they try to find a way to escape the city. In the process of the game, the player learns about the characters' pasts and the events that led to their being trapped in the city. He also learns about the city's secrets, which are kept by its residents.

The game features a variety of comics that tell the story of the game and introduce the player to the characters. The comics are done in the style of horror comics and add to the game's atmosphere of darkness and foreboding.

The beauty of it all!

The game features FMV sequences that tell about the characters' pasts and the events that led to their being trapped in the city. The FMV sequences are high-quality and add to the game's drama. And, of course, what can be expected from horror and noir, the game features two main female characters: Elizabeth, Jonathan's ex-wife, and Julie, a young woman who also found herself trapped. Both women are beautiful and charismatic, and they play an important role in the game's story and FMV sequences. Beautiful women, in one word.

The ending is not always good

Noctropolis is not just a game. It is a true work of art. Yes, I was not familiar with it in the 90s, but now, to my surprise, the game looks very powerful, mature, and stylish. It is very difficult not to admire the stylish comics, adult plot, and the work of the artists. Of course, the game has mixed ratings due to the rather strange and clunky controls,

14. 14. Ecstatica (1994)
------------------------

Ecstatica is an action-adventure horror game released in 1994 by British studio Andrew Spencer Studios. The second part was released in 1996.

This game is pain. It starts with pain!

For me, this is one of the closest games to Alone in the Dark in terms of gameplay and spirit. And just as little passable, unfortunately. I don't know why, but the atmosphere of the game seems to me to be more positive and less scary, but the same cannot be said for the monsters. Here they feel stronger and more natural, and this contributes to the difference in the source of fear between these two series.

In contrast to many games of those years, Ecstatica does not use the usual square polygons for locations. Instead, the technology of ellipsoid mapping is used - characters and objects seem to flow around the surface of the ellipsoid, creating the effect of a smooth organic space.

Look inside, run around, survive

This made it possible to achieve an unprecedented level of detail and realism for interiors in the game. Especially impressive are the large halls of the castle with many columns, arches, niches. The character can freely walk around these objects, examining them from all sides.

The game is set in a village captured by some dark forces. Our task is to explore locations, fight monsters and unravel the mystery of what is happening.

All of this is implemented in the classic action-RPG style with a third-person view. The controls are intuitive, the arsenal of weapons is diverse - from swords to crossbows.

I think I'm not on time

Ecstatica is remembered for its incredibly atmospheric interiors of a medieval castle, which thanks to the ellipsoid technology looked truly voluminous. This innovative approach has created new possibilities for games in the Action/RPG genre.

Today, the game may look a bit outdated, and in some places unfair, but due to the use of ellipsoid mapping, the visual component is head and shoulders above early polygonal 3D. So at least out of technical curiosity, I would recommend checking it out.

15. Creature Shock (1995)
-------------------------

Creature Shock is an action-adventure horror game developed by British studio Argonaut Games. The game is set aboard a spaceship in the distant future.

The source of horror is not always supernatural

Something about the source of horror in all games, except Doom, is something mystical (yes, if according to the lore of Doom, hell can also be attributed to mysticism, not pure sci-fi). But in the 80s and 90s there were wonderful horror movies like From Beyond, The Thing, Alien, after all. Well, what can I say, there were such ones too. And, as I mentioned, if Cyberia, a sci-fi action game with wandering through cyberspace between missions, was my favorite game on CD, then Cyberia, making me close my eyes, became a little crooked, with bugs, but even very passable (with the third truth attempt, in the first it was very scary, in the second - difficult, in the third - success) Creature Shock.

Even the screenshots are disgusting

Creature Shock is an action-adventure horror game developed by British studio Argonaut Games. The game is set aboard a spaceship in the distant future.

The game is set in 2123. Earth is on the brink of an ecological catastrophe, and humanity is looking for a new home. The spaceship "Amazon" under the command of Captain Sumoka sets off in search of a habitable planet. But the expedition ends in tragedy. In the very beginning, it turns out that a dangerous virus has leaked on the ship, which has mutated the crew into aggressive monsters. The "Amazon" is attacked by an unknown creature, and the ship crashes on a mysterious planet. Sumoka and her team are trapped, and they must fight for survival in a world full of terrible creatures.

Shooting at specific parts of the monsters

The gameplay is a mix of exploring locations, finding items to solve puzzles, and shooting enemies from a first-person perspective. The arsenal of weapons is supposedly different, but it doesn't matter - you will be forced to shoot at certain parts of the enemies - as a rule, these are disgusting growths that differ in color.

3D graphics for 1994

The graphics are decent by the standards of 1994 - well-developed 3D models of the ship, detailed sprites of monsters (hmm, robots? biomechanoids?). The sound design is also top-notch, with music and sound effects that heighten the tension of the action. Today, so to speak, so hard, because the game clearly lacks the pastoral of the same Cyberia, and it looks not very winning. But in its time, if you pay attention to the rating, its three-dimensional monsters and models were much more impressive with their novelty.

The last enemy, but not the last scene

Creature Shock is remembered for its interesting story and exciting hybrid of action and quest. Space horror in the spirit of the Alien movies came to video games thanks to this project Argonaut Games. Perhaps it was this game that made me learn, however strange it may sound, through the rescue from space worms literally what sticky fear is.
